<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Steel Wire Rope Sling Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ungalvanized</li><li>Galvanized</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Steel wire rope slings come in two different market types: ungalvanized and galvanized. Ungalvanized steel wire rope slings are made of untreated steel wires, making them susceptible to corrosion and rust over time when exposed to moisture and harsh environments. On the other hand, galvanized steel wire rope slings are coated with a layer of zinc, providing protection against corrosion and extending their lifespan. This galvanized coating also adds extra strength and durability to the sling, making it suitable for heavy-duty lifting applications in various industries.</p></p>
