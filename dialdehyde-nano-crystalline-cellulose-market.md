<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dialdehyde Nano-Crystalline Cellulose Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Sulfuric Acid Hydrolysis Method</li><li>Enzymatic Hydrolysis Method</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Dialdehyde Nano-Crystalline Cellulose is available in the market through two different methods: sulfuric acid hydrolysis and enzymatic hydrolysis. In the sulfuric acid hydrolysis method, cellulose is treated with sulfuric acid to break it down into smaller crystalline cellulose particles. This method is widely used and offers higher production volumes. On the other hand, the enzymatic hydrolysis method involves the use of enzymes to break down cellulose into nano-crystalline cellulose. This method is considered more environmentally friendly but has lower production capacity.</p></p>
