<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mechanical Pencils Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Screw-based</li><li>Ratchet-based</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>There are two main types of mechanical pencils in the market: screw-based and ratchet-based. Screw-based mechanical pencils are designed with a mechanism that moves the lead forward when the top of the pencil is twisted, allowing for a continuous supply of lead. On the other hand, ratchet-based mechanical pencils have a mechanism that advances the lead by pressing a button or clicking the top of the pencil, providing a fixed amount of lead with each click. Both types offer convenient and efficient ways to use and control the lead in the pencil.</p></p>
