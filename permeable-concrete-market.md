<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Permeable Concrete Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pervious Concrete</li><li>Porous Asphalt</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Permeable concrete market includes two major types: pervious concrete and porous asphalt. Pervious concrete is a type of concrete that is designed with gaps or voids to allow water to pass through, allowing for natural drainage and preventing stormwater runoff. Porous asphalt, on the other hand, consists of asphalt mixed with small aggregates that create voids, enabling water to infiltrate into the ground beneath. Both types promote sustainable urban infrastructure by reducing the need for traditional drainage systems and helping to replenish groundwater.</p></p>
