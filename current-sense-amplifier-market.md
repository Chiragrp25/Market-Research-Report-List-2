<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Current Sense Amplifier Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>High-side Sensing</li><li>Low-side Sensing</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Current Sense Amplifier market includes two types of sensing methods: high-side sensing and low-side sensing. In high-side sensing, the current flowing through the load is measured by placing the amplifier between the power supply and the load. This method is useful when the load is grounded or connected to low potential. On the other hand, low-side sensing involves placing the amplifier between the load and the ground. This method is suitable when the load is at high potential or when monitoring the current return path is important.</p></p>
