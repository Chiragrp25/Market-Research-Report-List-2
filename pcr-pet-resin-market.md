<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PCR PET Resin Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>m-PCR</li><li>c-PCR</li></ul></p>
<p><p>PCR PET Resin (Polyethylene Terephthalate Resin) is a type of plastic made from recycled PET bottles. There are two main types of PCR PET Resin in the market: m-PCR (mechanical recycling) and c-PCR (chemical recycling). m-PCR involves cleaning and grinding the PET bottles into flakes, which are then melted and processed into new resin. c-PCR, on the other hand, uses chemical processes to break down the PET bottles into their base components and then reconstruct them into new resin. Both types contribute to sustainable practices by reducing plastic waste and promoting circular economy.</p></p>
