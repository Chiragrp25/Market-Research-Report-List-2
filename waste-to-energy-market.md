<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Waste-to-Energy Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thermal Technologies</li><li>Biochemical Reactions</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The waste-to-energy market includes two main types: thermal technologies and biochemical reactions. Thermal technologies involve burning waste materials to generate heat, which is then used to produce electricity or heat energy. This method is commonly used in incineration and gasification processes. On the other hand, biochemical reactions involve the decomposition of organic waste by microorganisms to generate biogas, which can be converted into electricity or heat. This process, known as anaerobic digestion, is used in biogas plants and landfills. Both types contribute to the sustainable management of waste by producing renewable energy.</p></p>
