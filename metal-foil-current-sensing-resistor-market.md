<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Metal Foil Current Sensing Resistor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Through Hole</li><li>SMD</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The metal foil current sensing resistor market includes two main types: Through Hole and Surface Mount Device (SMD). Through Hole current sensing resistors are mounted on a printed circuit board by inserting leads through holes in the board, and are generally larger in size. SMD current sensing resistors, on the other hand, are smaller and directly soldered onto the surface of the circuit board. Both types serve the purpose of accurately measuring and controlling electronic currents, but they differ in terms of mounting style and size.</p></p>
