<p><p>Egg trays are containers specifically designed for the packaging and transportation of eggs. They are typically made from recycled paper pulp or plastic materials, providing a protective and hygienic environment for eggs during storage and distribution. These trays come in various sizes, with the most common options being 6-cavity, 12-cavity, and 30-cavity trays, depending on the desired capacity.</p><p>The current outlook for the egg trays market is positive and expected to witness substantial growth in the coming years. Factors driving this growth include increasing egg consumption due to a growing population, rising demand for convenient and safe egg packaging solutions, and the expanding commercial poultry industry.</p><p>Furthermore, the shift towards sustainable and eco-friendly packaging solutions is also expected to drive the demand for paper pulp egg trays. This is because egg trays made from recycled materials are biodegradable and can be easily recycled, aligning with the global focus on reducing plastic waste.</p><p>On the other hand, plastic egg trays offer advantages such as durability, ease of transportation, and extended shelf life. However, the increasing environmental concerns associated with plastic waste are expected to hamper the growth of plastic egg trays in the long term.</p><p>Considering these factors, the egg trays market is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.1% during the forecasted period.
