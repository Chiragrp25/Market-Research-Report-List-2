<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The White Wine Glasses Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Stemmed</li><li>Unstemmed</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>White wine glasses come in two main market types: stemmed and unstemmed. Stemmed glasses, also known as goblets, have a slender stem that allows drinkers to hold the glass without touching the bowl. This ensures that the wine's temperature and flavor remain unaffected by the heat of the hand. Unstemmed glasses, on the other hand, have no stem and are held by gripping the base or the sides. While unstemmed glasses are more casual and suitable for everyday use, stemmed glasses are considered more elegant and suitable for formal occasions.</p></p>
